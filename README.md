This is a side project I did during high school. I had just learnt the basics of python and got inspiried by the endless possibilities of coding.
I did some research and found that Pygame is a very useful library for anyone who wanted to code games in Python.
Pygame uses sprites and rectangles. Rectangles to act as collision dectecters while sprites to act as images/visuals for the game
Pong is the first game project I worked on. Since I was starting out, I wanted to stick to fundamentals first, 
and Pong was the best game to serve that purpose. I stuck to learning:
- Putting up simple visuals on the screen, 
- Detecting and handling inputs from the keyboard,
- Collision detections and its interaction

In the end, I got a bit carried away and implemented things that are not normally seen in Pong like
- 2 player options
- Playing in teams
- Settings to change the color of the paddle, background and ball


To run the game yourself, download the zip file and run the Pong python file in that folder.
