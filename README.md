This is a side project I did during high school. I had just learnt the basics of python and got inspiried by the endless possibilities of coding.
I did some research and found that Pygame is a very useful library for anyone who wanted to code games in Python.
Pygame uses sprites and rectangles. Rectangles to act as collision dectecters while sprites to act as images/visuals for the game
Pong is the first game project I worked on. Since I was starting out, I wanted to stick to fundamentals first, 
and Pong was the best game to serve that purpose. I stuck to learning:
- Putting up simple visuals on the screen, 
- Detecting and handling inputs from the keyboard,
- Collision detections and its interaction

In the end, I got a bit carried away and implemented things that are not normally seen in Pong like
- 2 player options
- Playing in teams
- Settings to change the color of the paddle, background and ball

Something I struggled with was figuring out how to have the paddle have 5 different sections so the ball can be hit in 5 different directions
depending on where it hit the paddle.
In the end, I just decided to create 5 different rectangles and put them together into one paddle and have each of them collide with the ball in their own way

To run the game yourself, download the zip file and run the Pong python file in that folder.
